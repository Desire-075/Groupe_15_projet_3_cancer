Medical Decision Support Application
Cervical Cancer Risk Assessment with Explainable ML (SHAP)

1. Introduction
This project aims to develop a clinical decision-support tool to assess cervical cancer risk among patients based on their medical history and behavioral factors. The goal is to deliver a complete solution that combines:

Accuracy and robustness of a machine learning model,
Transparency through SHAP visualizations that explain the predictions,
An intuitive user interface developed using Streamlit or Flask,
Professional software development practices (structured repository, automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions, and project management with Trello),
Prompt engineering documentation detailing the AI-generated prompts used throughout the workflow.
This README provides a detailed overview of our approach, repository structure, and answers to the critical questions specified in the project document.

2. Repository Structure
The repository is organized to facilitate collaboration and maintainability. Here’s an example directory structure:

3. Data Preprocessing
3.1 Source and Description
The dataset used is sourced from the UCI Repository and includes various pieces of information regarding patients’ medical history and behavioral factors.

3.2 Exploratory Analysis
Missing Values:

Identify any missing values.
Apply strategies such as imputation (using mean, median, or advanced techniques) or removal of certain rows/columns.
Outliers:

Detect outliers within the dataset.
Decide on an approach (transformation, removal, or specific handling) for managing these outliers.
Correlations:

Analyze correlations between features.
If high correlations are found, apply dimensionality reduction or feature selection techniques.
3.3 Handling Class Imbalance
The dataset is highly imbalanced, with approximately 85% "No risk" and 15% "At risk".

Approach:
In the model_training.py file, the SMOTE oversampling technique is applied to generate new instances for the minority class.
Impact:
Using SMOTE during training balances the dataset, reducing the model's bias toward the majority class and enhancing its ability to correctly identify patients at risk.
4. Modeling and Evaluation
4.1 Model Selection
At least three models have been chosen from the following options:

Random Forest Classifier
XGBoost Classifier
SVM
(Possibly CatBoost Classifier)
4.2 Evaluation Metrics
Each model is evaluated using the following metrics:

ROC-AUC
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
4.3 Best Model Selection
After several iterations, the XGBoost Classifier emerged as the best-performing model.

Example performance metrics (from the analysis notebook):

ROC-AUC: 0.92
Accuracy: 88%
Precision: 85%
Recall: 80%
F1-score: 82%
These results provided a good balance between sensitivity and specificity, guiding the final model selection.

5. Memory Optimization
5.1 Optimization Function
Within the data_processing.py file, the optimize_memory(df) function systematically adjusts data types (e.g., converting float64 to float32, int64 to int32) to reduce the DataFrame’s memory footprint.

5.2 Before/After Results
The analysis notebook (notebooks/eda.ipynb) demonstrates the memory improvements achieved after applying this function.

6. SHAP Explainability
6.1 Integration of SHAP Visualizations
SHAP summary plots are generated to interpret the model's predictions.
These visualizations help to identify the impact of each feature, both at a global level and on individual predictions.
7. User Interface
7.1 Interface Development
Technology: The user interface is developed using Streamlit (or Flask, based on project requirements).
Features:
Clinicians can input patient medical history and behavioral data.
The application displays risk predictions.
Interactive SHAP visualizations provide clear explanations of the model's decision-making process.
8. Continuous Integration and GitHub Workflow
8.1 GitHub Actions
A CI/CD workflow is configured via GitHub Actions (located in .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml) to automate testing and code validation upon each commit.
This setup ensures high code quality and deployment stability.
9. Conclusion and Future Directions
Summary: The project successfully integrates a robust machine learning model with SHAP explainability and an intuitive user interface, forming a comprehensive clinical decision-support tool.
Future Improvements: Possibilities for future enhancements include adding new functionalities, further optimizing model performance, and refining the user interface.
Installation and Usage:
